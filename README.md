This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Notes

```
React App:
In a React App, we can't able to see the content of the webpage in the source code displayed in the browser this is because the React manipulates the code inside the browser and runs inside the browser.

Next App:
In a Next App, the content is visible in the webpage, so that the page scrawler can find the actual content and its good for the SEO purpose.
Here, the entire HTML in rendered in the sever and returned to the client side.
